# Syllabus

## Overview

This is a class on how to design and collaborate on larger programming projects.
You learned the basics of C++ in CS 16. You learned how to organize your data in
CS 24.  Now you'll learn how to organize your programs themselves,  and also how
to work with external libraries.

To practice this organization,  you'll work on two large projects, with each one
taking about about half a quarter.  Meanwhile,  lectures will cover a variety of
intermediate to advanced C++ features (including inheritance, virtual functions,
and templates) as well as some operating systems topics, including processes and
threads.


## Materials

Everything in this class is optional except the programming assignments. I don't
take attendance. There is no required reading. There is no textbook.  Everything
we talk  about in this class is  common  computer science  material, and you can
find it online in whatever format you like best.

If you prefer learning from textbooks,  these are the textbooks used in previous
editions of CS 32.  You may have them already, as they're also used for CS 24.

## Coding

This is a C++ class, so you'll be coding in C++.  We'll be using C++ 17; add the
`-std=c++17` flag to use this standard when compiling your code.  Your code must
compile with no warnings;  add the `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Werror`  flags when
compiling to enforce this.

Auto-graded code  is required to  compile and run  on Gradescope.  Interactively
graded code is required to compile and run on the Linux computers in CSIL.

- Gradescope is currently running GCC 11.4.0 on Ubuntu 22.04.
- CSIL is currently running GCC 13.2.1 on Fedora 38.


## Grading

Your entire grade  comes from  programming assignments.  There will be two group
projects, with each project taking about four weeks. To make sure you don't fall
behind, you will be graded at checkpoints throughout the projects, approximately
one per week.  All checkpoints are equally weighted; there will be eight or nine
of them in total.

Programming assignments will be graded on correctness, but also on coding style,
process,  and documentation  (see the  Collaboration section  below).  Except in
extreme circumstances, group members all share the same grade.

Each group gets one late week per project. If you choose to use a late week, let
your TA know,  and your due date for the current checkpoint  will be pushed back
by one week.  Note that this  only applies to  _one_  checkpoint!  The following
checkpoint will still be due on its original due date.

I may decide  to curve the class;  if I do,  this will apply to your  cumulative
scores at the end of the quarter, and will only be in your favor. Getting 90% of
the possible points guarantees you at least an A-, 80% a B-, and so on.


## Collaboration

Because this  course focuses on collaboration,  you are  required to work on the
projects in groups.  A group can have anywhere from two  to four  members.  Each
checkpoint contains two mostly-independent features;  groups will split into two
teams that work on these features separately,  and then review each other's work
before it gets merged into the master branch.

Collaboration is all about communication! Therefore, you will be graded not only
on the correctness of your code, but also on your ability to write readable code
and communicate its purpose to others. This includes following coding standards,
documenting your code, and making sure all code goes though code review.


## Piazza

We'll be using Piazza as a Q&A forum. If you have a question that might apply to
other people as well, it's better to ask on Piazza than to send an email. If you
ask coding questions on Piazza, please:

- Post the smallest section of code that fully describes your problem.
- Include any code as a code snippet, not a screenshot or cell phone photo.
- If you include more than a few lines of your code, make your question private.


## Cheating

Your group is responsible for keeping your code private. Make sure you make your
GitHub repository a private one, and only share your code with your TAs.  If you
do decide to share code with other groups, keep in mind that the following apply
to all members of all groups involved:

- **First Offense:** Zero on the checkpoint _and_ final grade lowered by one letter.
- **Second Offense:** Fail the class.

The programming assignments  are involved enough that it's  virtually impossible
for anyone  to have the same code as you by accident.  As long as you write your
own code you have nothing to worry about.
